# Minimal-Genetic-Algorithm

GeneGenetic algorithms try to solve a computational problem following some principles of organic evolution. This model has didactic purposes; it can give us an answer to the simple arithmetic problem on how to find the highest natural number composed by a given number of digits. We approach the task using a genetic algorithm, where the possible answers to solve the problem are represented by agents, that in logo programming environment are usually named "turtles".
